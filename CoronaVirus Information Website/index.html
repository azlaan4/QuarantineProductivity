                        COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus-19) is a new strain of coronavirus (a large family of viruses) 
                        that had previously not been identified in humans. It first emerged in Wuhan, China, in 
                        December 2019, and has since been declared as an outbreak by World Health Organization (WHO).

                                            Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
                                            Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness 
                                            and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical 
                                            problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more 
                                            likely to develop serious illness.

                                        <p>
                                            The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, 
                                            the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your 
                                            hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.

                                            The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an 
                                            infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette 
                                            (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

                                            At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many 
                                            ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated 
                                            information as soon as clinical findings become available.

                                            The COVID-19 virus affects different people in different ways.  COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and 
                                            most infected people will develop mild to moderate symptoms and recover without requiring special 
                                            treatment.  People who have underlying medical conditions and those over 60 years old have a higher 
                                            risk of developing severe disease and death.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Common symptoms include:
                                        </p>
                                        <ul>

                                            <li>tiredness</li>
                                            <li>dry cough.</li>

                                        <p>
                                            Other symptoms include:
                                        </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>shortness of breath</li>
                                            <li>aches and pains</li>
                                            <li>sore throat</li>
                                            <li>and very few people will report diarrhoea, nausea or a runny nose.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>
                                            People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should self-isolate and contact their medical provider or a COVID-19 information line for advice on testing and referral.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            People with fever, cough or difficulty breathing should call their doctor and seek medical attention.
